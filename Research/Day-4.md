# KVM Advocate Website - Day 4 README

## Project Overview

KVM Advocate is a MERN-based website for a fictional law firm in LB Nagar, Hyderabad, specializing in cybercrime cases (e.g., digital arrests, phishing). It empowers victims to submit cases, book consultations, access resources, and track progress, fostering trust through secure features and empathetic design. This project showcases full-stack MERN skills and addresses Hyderabad’s cybercrime challenges.

## Day 4: Set Up Project Management and Timeline

### Objective
Create a Trello/Notion board and a 150-day timeline to organize tasks, track progress, and ensure completion of a trust-inspiring website by January 29, 2026.

### Deliverables
- **Trello/Notion Board**:
  - Columns: To Do, In Progress, Done, Backlog.
  - Completed tasks: Days 1–3 (brief, research, wireframes).
  - Tasks for Days 5–34 (e.g., “Day 5: Set up MERN stack,” “Day 9: Build Home page”).
  - Categories: Frontend, Backend, Design, Testing, Trust-Building.
- **Timeline**:
  - 5 phases: Planning (Days 1–4), Setup (Days 5–8), Core Development (Days 9–20), Advanced Features (Days 21–90), Polish and Launch (Days 91–150).
  - Milestones: Basic Prototype (Day 20), Live Demo (Day 30), Core Features (Day 60), Advanced Features (Day 90), Production-Ready (Day 120), Full Launch (Day 150).

### Tasks Completed
1. Set up Trello/Notion board with columns, labels, and Days 1–3 tasks.
2. Listed 30 tasks for Days 5–34 with deadlines and categories.
3. Created 150-day timeline with 5 phases and dependencies.
4. Added 6 milestones with success criteria (e.g., “Basic Prototype: 3 pages functional”).

### Testing
- **Manual Review**: Checked board for columns, labels, and Days 1–3 tasks.
- **Task List Validation**: Ensured Days 5–34 tasks cover core features and pain points.
- **Timeline Feasibility**: Verified 150-day timeline, phases, and milestones.
- **Peer Feedback**: Shared board with peer, confirming clarity and realism.

### Tools Used
- Trello/Notion: For task tracking and timeline.
- Google Docs: For task brainstorming.
- Chrome: For accessing tools.
- WhatsApp/Email: For peer feedback.

### Next Steps
- Day 5: Set up MERN stack project structure (Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB Atlas).

### Notes
- Tasks prioritize secure submission and trust signals (e.g., SSL badge) for data fears.
- Timeline condenses 6–12 months to 150 days using ChillBoard experience.
- Board is flexible for future features (e.g., AI chatbot in Backlog).
