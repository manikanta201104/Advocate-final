# KVM Advocate Website - Day 1 README

## Project Overview

KVM Advocate is a MERN-based website for a fictional law firm in LB Nagar, Hyderabad, specializing in cybercrime cases (e.g., digital arrests, phishing). The platform empowers victims to submit cases, book consultations, access resources, and track progress, inspiring trust through secure features, professional design, and empathetic messaging. This project showcases full-stack MERN skills (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and is tailored to Hyderabad’s growing cybercrime challenges.

## Day 1: Define Project Scope and Objectives

### Objective
Create a project brief outlining the website’s goal, pages, features, target users, and trust-building elements to guide development over 150 days.

### Deliverables
- **Project Brief**: A 1–2 page document (Google Docs/Notion) with:
  - **Overview**: Describes the website’s purpose to serve cybercrime victims.
  - **Problem Statement**: Highlights challenges like data privacy fears and legal confusion.
  - **Goal**: Build a trust-inspiring MERN platform with 10 pages.
  - **Success Metrics**: E.g., 50 mock submissions, 95% Lighthouse score.
  - **Pages**: 10 pages (Home, About Us, Services, Case Submission, Appointment Booking, Resource Hub, Case Progress Dashboard, Success Stories, Contact Us, FAQ).
  - **Features**: Secure case submission, appointment booking, live chat, resource hub, dashboard, trust signals.
  - **Target Users**: 4 personas (Professional, Retiree, Business Owner, Student).
  - **Trust Elements**: Professional design, CTAs, empathetic messaging, badges, testimonials.

### Tasks Completed
1. Wrote a project brief with overview, problem, goal, and metrics.
2. Listed 10 pages with descriptions and user journey roles.
3. Defined core features with technical requirements and trust-building purposes.
4. Identified 4 target user personas with goals and pain points.
5. Noted trust-building elements with examples and page placements.

### Testing
- **Manual Review**: Checked brief for clarity and completeness using Grammarly.
- **Peer Feedback**: Shared with a peer for feedback on clarity and relevance.
- **Alignment Check**: Verified features/personas address user needs (e.g., secure submission for privacy fears).
- **Future-Proofing**: Ensured brief supports scalability (e.g., MongoDB for future AI features).

### Tools Used
- Google Docs/Notion: For drafting the brief.
- Grammarly: For clarity checks.
- Miro/Pen-and-Paper: For brainstorming personas and trust elements.
- WhatsApp/Email: For peer feedback.

### Next Steps
- Day 2: Research Hyderabad cybercrime trends and create a user journey map to refine the brief.

### Notes
- The brief emphasizes trust-building to address cybercrime victims’ fears (e.g., data breaches).
- Hyderabad context (e.g., digital arrests, Telugu support) ensures local relevance.
- The document is flexible for future iterations (e.g., adding AI fraud detection).
