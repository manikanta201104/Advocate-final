## Day 11: Design Case Submission Form UI

### Objective
Develop a static Case Submission form UI in `CaseSubmission.js` with Tailwind CSS, featuring a dropdown, text area, file input, submit button, and security note, aligned with Day 3 wireframes and Day 2 trust-building goals.

### Deliverables
- **CaseSubmission.js**: Updated with form (case type dropdown, text area, file input, submit button) and security note, styled with Tailwind CSS (blue/white, mobile-friendly).
- **Tested**: Form UI verified at `localhost:3000/case-submission`, responsive and navigable.
- **Trello/Notion Update**: Day 11 tasks marked Done, screenshots saved.
- **GitHub Commits**: Changes pushed to `kvm-advocate` repository.

### Tasks Completed
1. Updated `CaseSubmission.js` with form structure: dropdown, text area, file input, submit button.
2. Styled form with Tailwind CSS: blue/white scheme, mobile-friendly, desktop grid layout.
3. Added security note ("Your data is encrypted") with icon placeholder.
4. Tested form UI for appearance, responsiveness, and navigation.

### Testing
- **Form Elements**: Verified dropdown, text area, file input, submit button styled and functional.
- **Security Note**: Confirmed visibility and alignment below form.
- **Responsiveness**: Tested mobile (375px) for stacked fields, desktop (1280px) for grid layout.
- **Navigation**: Ensured nav bar links (Home, Case Submission, Appointment Booking) work.
- **Peer Feedback**: Shared screenshots, confirmed usability.

### Tools Used
- VS Code: For editing `CaseSubmission.js` and terminal commands.
- Chrome: For testing and DevTools (mobile view).
- Terminal: For `npm start` and Git commits.
- Trello/Notion: For task updates.
- Tailwind CSS Docs: For styling reference.

### Next Steps
- Day 12: Build Appointment Booking page UI with Tailwind CSS and calendar/time picker per Day 3 wireframe.

### Notes
- Form aligns with Day 3 wireframe and Day 2 trust needs (e.g., "256-bit SSL" note).
- Blue/white scheme ensures professional aesthetic.
- Setup leverages ChillBoard’s React and Tailwind experience.
