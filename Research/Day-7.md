# KVM Advocate Website - Day 7 README

## Project Overview

KVM Advocate is a MERN-based website for a fictional law firm in LB Nagar, Hyderabad, specializing in cybercrime cases (e.g., digital arrests, phishing). It empowers victims to submit cases, book consultations, access resources, and track progress, fostering trust through secure features. This project showcases full-stack MERN skills and addresses Hyderabad’s cybercrime challenges.

## Day 7: Initialize React Frontend

### Objective
Set up a React frontend with Tailwind CSS and routing, enabling responsive, trust-building pages.

### Deliverables
- **Frontend Folder**: `kvm-advocate-frontend` with Create React App structure.
- **Dependencies**: `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer` in `package.json`.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Configured with `tailwind.config.js` and `index.css`.
- **App.js**: Navigation bar (`Navbar.js`) and routes for Home, Case Submission, Appointment Booking.
- **Components**: `Home.js`, `CaseSubmission.js`, `AppointmentBooking.js` as placeholders.
- **Trello/Notion Update**: Day 7 tasks marked Done, test results noted.

### Tasks Completed
1. Created `kvm-advocate-frontend` with `npx create-react-app`.
2. Installed `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`.
3. Initialized Tailwind CSS, verified styling.
4. Set up `App.js` with nav bar and routes.
5. Tested frontend navigation and responsiveness.

### Testing
- **Setup Check**: Verified folder structure and default app at `localhost:3000`.
- **Dependency Check**: Confirmed `package.json` updates.
- **Tailwind Test**: Tested styling with temporary div.
- **Routing Test**: Navigated routes, checked mobile responsiveness in DevTools.
- **Peer Feedback**: Shared screenshot, confirmed functionality.

### Tools Used
- VS Code: For file management and editing.
- Chrome: For testing and DevTools (mobile view).
- Terminal: For `npx create-react-app`, `npm install`, `npm start`.

### Next Steps
- Day 8: Build Home page UI with Tailwind CSS per Day 3 wireframe.

### Notes
