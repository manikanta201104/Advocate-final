## Day 16: Connect Appointment Booking to Backend

### Objective
Integrate the Appointment Booking form in `AppointmentBooking.js` with the POST `/api/appointments` API using Axios, create a GET `/api/lawyers/availability` endpoint, update FullCalendar.js to display available slots, and add a confirmation modal for a functional booking process.

### Deliverables
- **routes/lawyers.js**: GET `/api/lawyers/availability` route to fetch availability.
- **server.js**: Updated to mount lawyers router.
- **AppointmentBooking.js**: Integrated with Axios, FullCalendar slots, and modal.
- **Tested**: Full flow verified in Chrome, Postman, MongoDB, and notifications.
- **Trello/Notion Update**: Day 16 tasks marked Done, screenshots saved.
- **GitHub Commits**: Changes pushed to `kvm-advocate` repository.

### Tasks Completed
