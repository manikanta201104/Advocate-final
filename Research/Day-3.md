# KVM Advocate Website - Day 3 README

## Project Overview

KVM Advocate is a MERN-based website for a fictional law firm in LB Nagar, Hyderabad, specializing in cybercrime cases (e.g., digital arrests, phishing). It empowers victims to submit cases, book consultations, access resources, and track progress, fostering trust through secure features and empathetic design. This project showcases full-stack MERN skills and addresses Hyderabad’s cybercrime challenges.

## Day 3: Create Wireframes for Core Pages

### Objective
Sketch low-fidelity wireframes for Home, Case Submission, and Appointment Booking pages to visualize layouts, functionality, and trust-building elements, ensuring alignment with user needs and the Day 2 user journey.

### Deliverables
- **Wireframes** (PDF/image from Figma/Canva or photographed sketches):
  - **Home Page**: Navigation, hero with CTA (“Submit Your Case”), trust signals (“Featured in The Hindu,” “256-bit SSL”), success snippet, footer.
  - **Case Submission Page**: Navigation, secure form (dropdown, text fields, file upload, CTA), trust signals (“100% Confidential”), confirmation placeholder, footer.
  - **Appointment Booking Page**: Navigation, calendar (FullCalendar.js), consultation selector, booking form, trust signals (“Secure Video Consultations”), confirmation placeholder, footer.
- Each wireframe includes desktop/mobile layouts, CTAs, trust signals, and annotations.

### Tasks Completed
1. Sketched Home page wireframe with hero, trust signals, and success snippet.
2. Sketched Case Submission wireframe with secure form and trust badges.
3. Sketched Appointment Booking wireframe with calendar and booking form.
4. Added CTAs (e.g., “Submit Your Case”) and trust signals (e.g., “256-bit SSL”).
5. Ensured simple, mobile-friendly layouts with Tailwind CSS compatibility.

### Testing
- **Manual Review**: Checked wireframes for completeness (3–4 sections, CTAs, trust signals).
- **Alignment Check**: Verified wireframes address Day 2 pain points (e.g., confusion, data fears) and user journey stages.
- **Mobile-Friendliness**: Tested mobile layouts in Figma device preview for stacking and usability.
- **Peer Feedback**: Shared wireframes with a peer, confirming clarity and trust-building.

### Tools Used
- Figma: For digital wireframes and device previews.
- Canva: Alternative for simpler wireframes.
- Pen-and-Paper: For quick sketches.
- Google Drive: For storing PDFs/images.
- WhatsApp/Email: For peer feedback.

### Next Steps
- Day 4: Set up MERN stack project structure and create a development roadmap, using wireframes for guidance.

### Notes
- Wireframes address Day 2 pain points (e.g., SSL badge for data fears, simple form for confusion).
- Mobile layouts cater to Hyderabad’s mobile-heavy users (e.g., students).
- Designs are Tailwind CSS-compatible for easy React implementation.
