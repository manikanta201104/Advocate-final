# KVM Advocate Website - Day 8 README

## Project Overview

KVM Advocate is a MERN-based website for a fictional law firm in LB Nagar, Hyderabad, specializing in cybercrime cases (e.g., digital arrests, phishing). It empowers victims to submit cases, book consultations, access resources, and track progress, fostering trust through secure features. This project showcases full-stack MERN skills and addresses Hyderabad’s cybercrime challenges.

## Day 8: Set Up Git Repository and Testing Tools

### Objective
Create a GitHub repository for version control, configure `.gitignore`, and set up Jest and Postman for testing, ensuring a reliable, portfolio-ready project.

### Deliverables
- **GitHub Repository**: `kvm-advocate` with `kvm-advocate-backend` and `kvm-advocate-frontend`.
- **.gitignore**: Root, backend, and frontend files excluding `node_modules`, `.env`, `build/`.
- **Initial Commits**: Backend (Express, MongoDB) and frontend (React, Tailwind) pushed.
- **Jest Setup**: Installed for backend and frontend, with a test for `/api/test`.
- **Postman Collection**: Requests for `/api/test` and `/api/test-user`.
- **Trello/Notion Update**: Day 8 tasks marked Done, screenshots saved.

### Tasks Completed
1. Created `kvm-advocate` GitHub repo and initialized Git.
2. Updated `.gitignore` for root, backend, frontend.
3. Pushed backend and frontend code to GitHub.
4. Installed Jest, React Testing Library, and supertest.
5. Set up Postman collection for API testing.
6. Wrote and ran Jest test for `/api/test`.

### Testing
- **GitHub Check**: Verified repo and remote URL.
- **.gitignore Validation**: Confirmed excluded files ignored.
- **Git Push**: Checked backend/frontend files on GitHub.
- **Jest Setup**: Verified installation and configuration.
- **Jest Test**: Ran `/api/test` test, confirmed pass.
- **Postman Test**: Tested GET `/api/test` and POST `/api/test-user`.
- **Peer Feedback**: Shared repo and test results, confirmed functionality.

### Tools Used
- VS Code: For file editing and terminals.
- GitHub: For version control.
- Postman: For API testing.
- Chrome: For GitHub access.
- Terminal: For Git and Jest commands.
- Trello/Notion: For task updates.

### Next Steps
- Day 9: Build Home page UI with Tailwind CSS per Day 3 wireframe.

### Notes
- Single repo simplifies version control.
- Tests align with Day 2 trust-building (secure APIs).
- Setup leverages ChillBoard’s Git and testing experience.
