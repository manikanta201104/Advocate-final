# KVM Advocate Website - Day 2 README

## Project Overview

KVM Advocate is a MERN-based website for a fictional law firm in LB Nagar, Hyderabad, specializing in cybercrime cases (e.g., digital arrests, phishing). It empowers victims to submit cases, book consultations, access resources, and track progress, inspiring trust through secure features and empathetic design. This project showcases full-stack MERN skills and addresses Hyderabad’s cybercrime challenges.

## Day 2: Research Cybercrime Needs and User Journey

### Objective
Research Hyderabad’s cybercrime landscape to identify prevalent issues and user pain points, and create a user journey map to ensure the website meets real-world needs while fostering trust.

### Deliverables
- **Research Notes** (Google Docs/Notion):
  - **Cybercrime Landscape**: Covers digital arrests (₹1.1 lakh–₹5.9 crore losses), phishing/OTP scams (~10 weekly cases), investment fraud (e.g., ₹1.98 crore), and others (e.g., job scams). Hyderabad lost ₹385 crore in 2024; seniors and professionals are key targets.
  - **Pain Points**: Confusion about filing cases, data leak fears, need for quick help, social stigma, lack of awareness, financial recovery concerns.
  - **Trust Signals**: Tailored for each journey stage (e.g., SSL badge for case submission, testimonials on Services).
- **User Journey Map** (Miro/Figma, exported as PDF/image):
  - Stages: Visitor, Exploration, Action, Engagement, Retention, Advocacy.
  - Includes user actions, pages, emotions, and pain points addressed (e.g., “Clear form reduces confusion”).

### Tasks Completed
1. Researched Hyderabad cybercrimes using The Hindu, Times of India, and police websites, documenting digital arrests, phishing, and more.
2. Identified 6 pain points tied to personas (e.g., retirees’ confusion) and website solutions (e.g., clear FAQs).
3. Created a user journey map for a retiree, covering 6 stages with actions, emotions, and trust signals.
4. Noted trust signals for each stage (e.g., “Featured in The Hindu” on Home).

### Testing
- **Manual Review**: Checked research notes for 5–7 cybercrime types, Hyderabad context, and brief alignment.
- **Pain Point Validation**: Ensured pain points are research-backed and tied to solutions.
- **Journey Map Review**: Verified intuitive flow, stage completeness, and pain point coverage.
- **Peer Feedback**: Shared notes/map with a peer, confirming clarity and relevance.

### Tools Used
- Chrome: For research.
- Google Docs/Notion: For notes and trust signals.
- Miro/Figma: For user journey map.
- Grammarly: For clarity checks.
- WhatsApp/Email: For peer feedback.

### Next Steps
- Day 3: Sketch wireframes for Home and Case Submission pages, using research and journey map to ensure alignment with user needs.

### Notes
- Research emphasizes seniors’ vulnerability to digital arrests, informing trust signals like “100% Confidential.”
- Journey map prioritizes intuitive navigation (e.g., 2 clicks to case submission).
- Notes and map are flexible for future refinements (e.g., adding Telugu support).
